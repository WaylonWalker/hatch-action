# Markata Action

This action bumps [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/version/) hatch
projects.  This is pretty rigidly setup for my workflow, and is not likely to
work for everyone.  If you want something different, fork it and make it work
for you.

## Example usage

``` yaml
- uses: waylonwalker/hatch-version-action
```
